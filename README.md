# Quorum
The purpose of this project is to provide a 'quorum' based implementation to facilitate reliable independent processes. For example, a quorum based Windows service could communicate with its peers to ensure there is only and always a 'master' operating, thus avoiding the traditional single point of failure in Windows services.

The implementation at the time of writing (7th November 2015) is operational with an HTTP implementation.
